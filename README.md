An LLM trained on text from my conlang. Currently, the amount of text is small and much of it is not high quality data. As a result, it is not able to create sentences that make sense, although it can create a few words (Words being composed of multiple syllables separated by a space like *ſᶘɹ }ʃᴜ* which is one word, *tsiina*). Once the number of texts grows, this will likely change.

The "֭֭ſɭɹ ſ͕ȷɹƽ" folder is composed of unused or obselete parts and is not needed for it to work. "ſɭɔ j͑ʃ'ɔ.py" is used to generate sentences.
